# The supplementary information for evolution of cooperation for bots within mobile population

"SI_v1.gif" shows that the evolution dynamic of the scenario without bot, in which ordinary quickly falls into a frozen state, that is, no longer updating strategies and migrating.

"SI_v2.gif" shows that evolution dynamic of the scenario with minor migration noise bot (p=0.01), the introduction of mobile bots helps feed cooperation in migration and may drive coopertors to gather even after the defectors become extinct.

"SI_v3.gif" shows that evolution dynamic of the scenario with minor random movement bot (p=1), the bots can spread cooperation faster.

"SI_v4.gif" shows that the result without bots when considering the slight (q=0.0001) behavioral noise of ordinary individuals.

"SI_v5.gif" shows that the result with minor migration noise bot (p=0.01) when considering the slight (q=0.0001) behavioral noise of ordinary individuals.
